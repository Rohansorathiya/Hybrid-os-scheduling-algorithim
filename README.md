# Hybrid-os-scheduling-algorithim
The hybrid scheduling algorithm combines the Round Robin (RR) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling techniques to
optimize process scheduling in operating systems, aiming to achieve a balance between fairness and efficiency by
considering the burst time of processes.
â€¢ Implemented a highly accurate CPU scheduling algorithm outperforming other methods, improving process efficiency.
